# ue5-topdown-camera
A super simple unreal engine 5 top down camera that works with both mouse and touch input.

To preface all this - I know zero C++ and this was generated with the help of Grok + Gemini 3 pro. 

I spent weeks tooling around in blueprints and searching google/youtube/reddit looking for this and FINALLY managed it. Sharing it incase people need it later (and incase I lose it locally).

Tested with UE 5.6.1 on Mac/Windows/iOS. 

I provide zero support for any of this. Use at your own risk.
